# _printf

A formatted output conversion C program completed as part of the low-level
programming and algorithm track at ALX. The program is a pseudo-
recreation of the C standard library function, `printf`.

This project is a combined effort of two collaborators:

The programs above perform the following tasks:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `_printf.c` | Implements a version of the `printf` function where the main function is the `_printf()` function |
| `functions.c` | Functions for printing different types of data: `char`, `string`, `percent sign`, `int`, & `binary` |
| `functions1.c` | Defines several functions for printing unsigned integers in different formats | 
| `functions2.c` | Contains several functions that handle different types of inputs for a custom `print` function |
| `get_glags.c` | Calculates the active flags in the formatted string and returns the value of these flags |
| `get_precision.c` | Calculates the precision for printing |
| `get_size.c` | Calculates the size of the argument to be casted, and returns it |
| `get_width.c` | Calculate the width for printing in a formatted string |
| `handle_print.c` | Prints an argument based on its type |
| `main.c` | Tests for the `_printf` function |
| `main.h` | Prototypes for the various functions used in the program |
| `utils.c` | Contains several utility functions for the program |
| `write_handlers.c` | Contains the write functions |
